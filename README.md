# Deep Learning Resources 2020

This repository consists of all the best implementation of some of the best techniques for classification, object detection and various deep learning algorithms for real world use case. 


  * [Image Classification using Xception](https://github.com/kool7/Deep_Learning_Resources_2020/blob/master/%5Bkeras_io%5D_Image_classification_from_scratch.ipynb) - "You now can train a really good image classification model on 25k images in less than 2 hours, entirely for free, on a Colab GPU. And it's dead easy. What a time to be alive. I remember when you had to write your own CUDA and C++ and you needed a hardware budget" -  [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet)
